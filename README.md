# Discord Bot Command Documentation

This document describes the usage and behavior of each slash command available in the bot. Commands are categorized into **Admin**, **Default (User)**, and **Manual Admin** functionalities. These commands primarily interact with a local SQLite database, awarding or deducting points from users, and managing moderation workflows.

## üîê Permissions & Notes

- All admin and manual commands require moderator privileges via the `@is_mod()` check.
- Commands rely on the naming format of threads to extract user IDs (e.g., `request_613425008575905856`).
- SQLite database access is done via `local_db`, which must be properly initialized in `main.py`.
- Logs are sent to the Discord channel defined by `config.LOG_CHANNEL_NAME`.
- Users must have DMs open to receive confirmation/denial messages.
